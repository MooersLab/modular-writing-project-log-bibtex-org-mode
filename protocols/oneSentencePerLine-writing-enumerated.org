# Reasoning behind writing one sentence per line
1. Eases rewriting by shuffling sentences within and between paragraphs by moving them up and down with the meta-arrows keys in Emacs.
2. Eases using Control-K to delete a line (a sentence) and paste it elsewhere in other text editors.
3. Provides a built-in constraint on long sentences.
4. It eases identifying where sentence length needs variation.
5. A sentence is a complete thought and the primary writing unit, so it deserves its own line.
6. Eases  checks on the overuse of the same word at the start of adjacent
7. Aids the identification of incomplete sentences.
8. Removes doubt about where the next sentence starts--it always starts at the left margin.
9. Why wrap sentences? We do it to save paper and money for publishers. This does not make sense in the age of electronic media.
10. Why wrap sentences? Some claim that sentence wrapping promotes reading comprehension: I think it deters it.
11. Caution: Code in minted blocks will run off the right margin if not line-wrapped with a line break.
12. Caution: Most people are not used to seeing one sentence per line and may give you puzzled looks and make inquisitive comments.
