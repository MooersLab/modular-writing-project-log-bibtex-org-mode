# Protocol for using Grammarly on Overleaf
- Overleaf is great for collaborative writing and editing.
- Chrome has the TextArea extension that is needed to run Grammarly in Overleaf.
- Use the shortcuts (new commands defined in the preamble) to save time typing.
- Where shortcuts are not possible, use templates.
- Overleaf with Chrome is able to run Grammarly via the Chrome Grammarly extension.
- Code snippets can be mapped to voice commands in Voice In Plus to compensate for the lack of snippet support in Overleaf.
