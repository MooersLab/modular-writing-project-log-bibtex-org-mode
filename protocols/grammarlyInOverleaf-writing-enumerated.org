# Protocol for using Grammarly on Overleaf
1. Overleaf is great for collaborative writing and editing.
2. Chrome has the TextArea extension that is needed to run Grammarly in Overleaf.
3. Use the shortcuts (new commands defined in the preamble) to save time typing.
4. Where shortcuts are not possible, use templates.
5. Overleaf with Chrome is able to run Grammarly via the Chrome Grammarly extension.
6. Code snippets can be mapped to voice commands in Voice In Plus to compensate for the lack of snippet support in Overleaf.
