# Periodic review workflow
1. Review checklist for manuscript completion.
2. Review timeline and milestones.
3. Review periodic assessments of the current state. Address the following questions:
  4. How far is the manuscript from being completed (in percent completion)?
  5. What keeps the manuscript from being submitted today?
  6. List what is missing from the manuscript that could improve its impact.
  7. What could be removed from the manuscript to streamline it?
