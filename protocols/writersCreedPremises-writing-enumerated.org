# List of premises behind the writer's creed.
1. Writing is any activity that advances a writing project. Most of the time spent on these writing activities does not involve generative writing.
2. Generative writing is the most valuable activity: All other activities descend from it.
3. Generative writing and editing use different parts of the brain, so they should be done at separate times.
4. Generative writing is best done when half awake because your internal editor is not fully on so new ideas are more likely to evade your internal editor and make it onto the page.
5. Generative writing can be done well by dictation while commuting if the *writing triggers* are planned before the commute. Writing triggers are topics to be expanded upon in a paper. The triggers are meant to initiate and guide the dictation but not constrain it. News ideas often emerge during the dictation. Triggers can also be used when not commuting. Take care if commuting by driving a car: This can be a form of distracted driving. Cell phones are not designed for this task: Use a 80 dollar digital voice recorder instead.
6. Editing is best done when fully awake because your internal editor will be activated. (Be careful; late-night editing can keep you awake later than intended and interfere with your sleep pattern with a productivity hit to be paid the following day.)
7. Most of the time spent on actual *writing* involves **rewriting**.
8. Planning is an important (underemphasized) component of writing.
9. Writing includes any activity that advances a writing project.
10. The word count does not capture most writing-related activities. Hence, the time spent on these activities must be tracked to document these efforts.
11. Time tracking is an essential component of time management. It is hard to manage what you do not measure. **Writing involves a lot of time management!!**
12. Per day, 90 minutes of generative writing on one project is the optimal time due to our [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezT8kGzYOng][ultradian cycles]]. Longer stretches of writing on one project are known as *binge writing*, which always leads to diminishing returns.
13. Writing includes reading the papers that you cite and those that you do not wind up citing. This reading activity can rejuvenate your momentum and inspire new ideas. It is best done in the evening so your subconscious can work overnight with the new insights. **Writing involves feeding your subconscious: Feed our head!**. Reading is grossly underemphasized in books about writing. Time should be scheduled for it else it is less likely to be done.
14. Writing includes mundane tasks like managing bibliographic libraries and making figures; these are suitable afternoon activities.
15. Writing includes data analysis.
