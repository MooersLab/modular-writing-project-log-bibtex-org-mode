This template is in Org mode \cite{Dominik2016TheOrgMode9ReferenceManualOrganizeYourLifeWithGNUEmacs}.
Org-mode aims to be a used for organizing your life, managing knowledge, doing literate programming, and preparing manuscripts.
It can be used to teach programming \cite{Birkenkrahe2023TeachingDataScienceWithLiterateProgrammingTools}.
Many people prefer to work in org-mode all day.


This template is similar to the writing log formatted for LaTeX.
They share much of the same preamble.
It is exported from org-mode through LaTeX to PDF.
This file compiles by entering \textbf{C-c C-e l o} without using an init.el file (e.g., \textbf{emacs -Q logXXXX.org}), but you may have to export it twice to get all of the changes in the source file deployed in the PDF.
You have to wait half a minute for the compiled document to appear.
The compiling is faster in LaTeX and on Overleaf.
This does not matter much because I mostly read and work with the org file when planning my writing session.

This template contains a table of contents, numbered outline, and an index that support navigating the document when it has been rendered into a PDF.
The label and ref macros are part of LaTeX's hyperlinking system.
Items in the table of contents and in the index are hyperlinked to sites in the body of the writing log.
You can navigate to different sections of the document by clicking on the file outline in this left column.

The comments in the GUIDNACE drawers are usually hidden to reduce the clutter in the document.
The comments  provide a quick access to suggested ways of using a section.
Put the cursor on the title of the drawer and enter tab to open the drawer.
Repeat to close the drawer.
The GUIDANCE drawers are under a headline with a :noexport: tag.

:GUIDANCE:
By listing projects that are closely and even somewhat distantly related
to the project at hand, it is possible to identify some synergies that
might otherwise be overlooked. For example, when working in a new area,
it is often useful to capitalize on the investment made in reading in
the new field by capturing those insights in the form of a review
article or book chapter. If you use Overleaf, you can include a
hyperlink to the project's webpage.

** Draft Introduction

:END:
#+Latex:\index{draft!introduction}
*** Guidance on draft introduction for the paper                     :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
In this section and in the next two sections, we assemble the key
components of the paper. You may wonder why we did not do this in the
manuscript document. We find it easier to keep this prose close to the
other lists in the sections that follow these subsections. In other
words, we are using the writing log as an incubator for the initial
drafts of these components of the paper.

We craft a two-paragraph introduction following the method of Lindsay
(Lindsay 2020 Scientific Writing Thinking In Words 2nd Ed). We do this
drafting in the writing log until we are satisfied that we have a vision
of the project that is clear enough to proceed. At this point, we
transfer the draft introduction to the main manuscript.

** Potential results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: subsec:Results.
:END:
#+Latex:\index{draft!results}
*** Guidance on draft introduction for the paper                     :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
This section contains a list of the potential key results that are vital
to addressing the central hypothesis. Usually, there are 4 to 6 key
results. Yes, we can think about the nature of the results even before
we have performed the experiments.

We are not necessarily thinking about the expected results, but we can
guess about the nature of the results with regard to whether they will
be in the form of a table, a graph or an image. We then do an initial
sorting of the results on the basis of how much weight they bear upon
testing the central hypothesis. This sorting will be the order in which
the results are presented, in contrast to the general tendency to
deliver the results in the order in which we obtain the results. At this
point, we might even draft an initial paragraph for the results section
that outlines the order of the results. This initial paragraph helps to
set the reader's expectations about the results that follow. After this
initial paragraph is assembled and the planned results are listed, we
will transfer this text to the main manuscript.

** Potential discussion points

#+Latex:\index{draft!discussion}
*** Guidance on draft discussion points for the paper                     :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
After some years of experience in a particular field, one has a sense of
the critical discussion points about how the proposed results will
relate to the results from the work of others. The content of this
discussion is supposed to be about the relationship of our results to
those reported by others. Sometimes, we expand these discussion points
into initial paragraphs. After we think this section is well-developed,
we will transfer it to the main manuscript.
:END:



** Prior discussion points
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: subsec:priorDiscussion
:END:
#+Latex:\index{draft!prior discussion points}
*** Guidance on prior discussion points for the paper                     :noexport:
:GUIDNACE:
The discussion section should contain new points of discussion. If you
are writing a series of papers about a topic, it is all too easy to
recycle old discussion points. Before making the transfer mentioned
above, we will check the proposed discussion points against those we
have published to avoid repeating ourselves and remind ourselves to
review our new results against our prior discussion points. You can
check this list against the discussion section of your current
manuscript to ensure that you are raising new points or updating prior
points while appropriately citing yourself. The new results may require
that we update our published discussion points.

*** Guidance on potential titles for the paper                     :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
Titles of 3-7 words long are easier for people to remember. We generally
iterate through enough titles to find one that is catchy. Sometimes,
this requires generating a list of more than 100 titles. This work takes
time and should not be delayed until the day of manuscript submission.

Below is a list of potential keywords. Abstracting services use the
title and abstract to extract terms for searching. As a result, select
keywords that are not in these two parts of the paper. Usually, there is
a limit on the number of keywords, so we choose the keywords carefully.
We make a long list of keywords and select the best ones.

:GUIDANCE:
After filling in the above subsections, we are in a solid position to
draft the abstract for the paper. This is just a draft and will be
updated as the results emerge. However, going through this exercise is
another way of visualizing the paper's contents and helps to strengthen
that vision. Such clarity is essential to maintain momentum.

:GUIDANCE:
A common mistake is to delay the assembly of the list of acronyms and
abbreviations. An incomplete list tells the reviewer that the authors
assembled the manuscript in a hurry.
:END:


#+begin_quote
Acronyms/Abbreviations/Initialisms should be defined the first time they
appear in each of three sections: the abstract; the main text; the first
figure or table. When defined for the first time, the
acronym/abbreviation/initialism should be added in parentheses after the
written-out form.

:GUIDANCE:
It is never too early to start writing the cover letter for a project.
This letter is another form of summary that is part of the actualization
of the project. If we have enough energy and time left over from
completing the initialization of the writing project, we may proceed to
drafting the cover letter. The advantage of doing so is to capture one's
excitement about the project.

*** Guidance on plans to support the writing project                     :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
 While it is useful to write about half of a manuscript in four hours in the first sitting without having done any experiments to provide a mental framework for the project and limit the scope, the work will need to be done.
 If the work is computational or experimental, many plans exist to get it done.
 Several plans must be developed to execute the work required to complete and submit the manuscript.
 These plans might not be written down many times, but it is probably quite useful to actually articulate them somewhere.
 These plans may not necessarily have to reside inside the writing log: A link to the plan in a plain text or an HTML file may be sufficient.
 Some of these plans are global in nature and may be applicable across all projects.
Some plans may be specific to the project at hand and must be elaborated on.
If these plans are relatively short, they could be included in the writing log, but if they are lengthy, it might be necessary to just provide a link to them.

This section is to plan the completion of the manuscript and for making periodic assessments of its status.
Having the checklist and the timeline adjacent each other will aid the scheduling of remaining tasks.
The assessment of the current state could be included within the diary section, but we think it is more useful to include it in this area near the timeline and the checklist for completion.
By having the assessments adjacent to each other, you should be able to see more clearly how progress is being made on the manuscript.

*** Guidance on Timeline with milestones                                :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
This is the planning section where the calendar is matched up with milestones: goals without deadlines are just dreams.
This is a tricky section to include inside of a writing log document because it often requires a heavy-duty external Library to be able to generate an image.
This could be done by simply copying the checklist and pasting it into this section as a table with three columns: milestone, target date, and achievement date.
This would lead to a very long table that might be too cluttered.
There might be a subset of the items in the checklist that are larger in scope that could be listed.
For example, completion of various parts of the writing log, key experiments, and solicitation of outside expertise.
The setting up of the time timeline will be very Project Specific and will require customization.
The main thing is to keep it simple enough to be useful but no simpler than necessary.

*** Guidance on next action                                :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
List the next task or action to be taken to move the project forward.
The section is supposed to contain one to do item. It is the next task
that needs to be done. The idea to determine in at the end of the
current work session what the next action should be so that you do not
have to spend time selecting the next action item when you return to the
project. This idea came from David Allen, the author of "Getting things
done".

I have to admit that I rarely do this task next. I generally reconsider
all of the pending to-do's at the start of my work session, and I often
wind up identifying a new task that was not identified as the "Next
Action" at the end of the last work session. Anyways, you do gain the
peace of mind knowing that you have identified the next step, although
you may not take it. If you do not use this section, go ahead and delete
it.

#+LaTeX:\index{To be done}
*** Guidance on to be done                               :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
These are the tasks that are thought to be required to get the project
finished. The prioritizing of the tasks is the hard part. The book "Time
Power" by Charles Hobbs provides helpful guidance on setting priorities.
I use an unordered list below but you can use a list of TODO items and
include this org file in the list of source files for the generation of
TODOs in org agenda. I generally would have an overwhelming number of
TODOs so I do not use org-agenda in this fashion.

*** Guidance on Writing Progress Notebook                               :noexport:
:GUIDANCE:
# The writing progress notebook enables the tracking of progress on a
# project basis [fn:1]. The Notebook automatically updates sums of words
# written and minutes spent across all projects on a given day. It only
# takes a few seconds to enter the number of words written and the time
# spent for a specific project on that project's Google Sheet. If you have
# Voice In plus activated, say the words "open sheet 37" to have the
# worksheet for project 37 opened in the web browser. If not, click on
# this direct link to the Google Sheet in the compiled PDF of this writing
# log [fn:2].

# Update the sheet for this project with the total number of minutes spent
# on this project and the word count. The word count is accessed in
# Overleaf under the menu pull-down. The word count operation has to be
# applied to a recently compiled tex document.

:GUIDANCE:
This section stores tasks that are related to the current project and
that may be worth doing someday. Often these tasks are tangential to
addressing the central hypothesis of the paper. This is a place for
capturing those wonderful ideas. Sometimes these ideas blossom into new
projects. This section can capture ideas that might be mentioned in
terms of future work in the discussion section of the manuscript.
